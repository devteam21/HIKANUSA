Just remember, that file contain (PHP BACKEND & ANDROID SOURCE) is very deprecated therefore you need update the grandle, core and library for work in 2021.
I'am not pretty sure it'll be work 100% I just wanna help who looking for code. (This code from codecanyon i've search in safest forums)

<h2 align="center">WHY DO I REMOVE MY SOURCE CODE??</h2>
<p align="center">
Because many of you email me asking for the php backend source code and some say my source code doesn't work, of course it will be an error because it must have 2 important components namely the php backend and the android code itself, So instead of being obscure and disappointing, I'll delete it...
